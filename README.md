## Why does this Repo exist if [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com) offers a pre-patched JetBrainMono font?
The reason is simple: The font is mono-spaced including the icons. Thus all icons are smaller than expected when using [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with icons or any other cli-tool that relies on icons like [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd). That is why I patched the font with icons of the original size by using the [nerd fonts patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher) and uploaded them here.
